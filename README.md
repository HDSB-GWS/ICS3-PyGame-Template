# Pygame Project

## This is where you will submit your project

1. Complete the project plan BEFORE coding begins
2. You are required to commit and push your changes to your repository minimum at the *end of every class that you work on your assignment* with your current code **even if you have not completed it**
3. If you have additional resources such as images, organize them into folders.
